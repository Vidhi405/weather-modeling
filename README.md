# weather-modeling
This is a Software-Engineering LABORATORY Experiment where we students were asked to write a python code to implement weather modeling using quadratic solution, i.e by using quadratic equation.

The first python code(first_quadratic.py) is the code for theoretical values such as the temperature at 6AM, then at 12NOON and 6PM. At 6AM and 6PM the temperature was taken to be less and at 12NOON it was predicted to be the highest/hottest.

The second python code(second_quadratic.py) is the actual code which contains the theoretical value as well as the actual values, taken from google weather(not the best source, but i had to take the readings from somewhere to check the accuracy).
