1. Requirements Analysis and Specification:
•	Define the scope:
Clearly define the objectives of the weather model. For example, predicting temperature, humidity, or rainfall.
•	Gather inputs:
Identify the necessary weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) and their data sources.
•	Determine accuracy requirements:
Define the desired level of accuracy for the predictions.
•	Specify output format:
Determine how the model's output will be presented (e.g., hourly forecasts, daily summaries).
•	Document requirements:
Create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlining all the above. 
2. Design:
•	System Architecture:
Design the overall structure of the weather modeling system, including data input, processing, and output components.
•	Quadratic Model Design:
Develop the specific mathematical equations for the quadratic model. This includes defining the coefficients and how they relate to the input parameters.
•	Data Handling:
Design how the input data will be processed (cleaning, scaling, etc.) and how the model's output will be stored.
•	User Interface:
Design how the user will interact with the system (e.g., a graphical interface for input and output). 
3. Implementation:
•	Coding: Translate the design into actual code using a suitable programming language (e.g., Python, R).
•	Unit Testing: Test individual components or modules of the code to ensure they function correctly.
•	Integration: Combine the different modules into a cohesive system. 
4. Testing and Integration:
•	System Testing: Test the entire system to ensure it meets the requirements defined in the SRS.
•	Verification: Verify that the model's predictions are accurate and reliable. This involves comparing the model's output with real-world weather data.
•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Allow users to test the system and provide feedback. 
5. Deployment and Maintenance: 
•	Deployment:
Deploy the system to the intended environment (e.g., a server, a cloud platform).
•	Maintenance:
Regularly monitor the system's performance and make necessary updates or bug fixes.
